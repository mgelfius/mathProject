# Current Features
    - Calculate large numbers to large exponents (or small numbers to small exponents if you're feeling saucy)
    - Calculate the number at a certain index in the Fibonacci sequence
    - Calculate angles in degrees or radians
    - Reduce fractions

# Upcoming Features
    - I've honestly got no clue. There was no direction when I started this for fun, so I'm kinda just wingin it

This is all in a gui written entirely in Python
